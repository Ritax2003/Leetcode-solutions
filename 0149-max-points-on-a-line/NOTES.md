1. We will select point and for every selected point we will calculate the slope wr.t to another point and store into the map
2. In map we will store <slope,that selected point>
* Â for example we have point :-[[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]......
we pick point [1,1]and for that [1,1] we will calculate the slope
w.r.t [2,2] ,[3,3]....... and store like this-
for understanding purpose i'm writing
mp[slope1,[1,1]]
mp[slope2,[1,1]]
mp[slope1,[1,1]].........
This type we will store the slope for [2,2] , [3,3],....
3. After storing the slope into map we will calculate the max point for that slope
For example after storing the slope map can look like this
[2/3,3]
[-90,1]//for perpendicular case
[1/3,2]...
find the max number of points having the same slope w.r.t. that selected point :-means which slope have maximum point
:- here 2/3 have 3 point so our answer will be 3+1(we are adding that point as well)
